Infrastructure Disclosure Platforms (IDP) is CoST- the Infrastructure Transparency Initiative- effort to support CoST Members and other partners to contribute, explore and reuse open-source digital tools, which can be used in the design and implementation of the CoST disclosure journey aiming to improve transparency and accountability in the infrastructure sector around the world.

CoST believes that open-source codes developed by our members or partners should be publicly available to help us to contribute to delivering quality infrastructure, strengthening economies, and improving lives.

Therefore, CoST encourages those who contribute to the improvement of these digital tools, to share them with the IPD manager. If when reusing this digital tool, you consider that:

- Have added some new functionality with which you add value for more people to reuse,
- Have made the tool more versatile to support new updates,
- Have fixed some existing bugs,
- Or have simply improved the user interface or documentation of it.


CoST encourages you to return the progress made to the repository. Follow these steps to contribute to the digital tool:

- Fork the repository.
- Develop the new functionality or make the changes you create that add value to the tool.
- Make a "pull request" documenting in detail the proposed changes in the repository.
- In such case, your name will be registered in the list of attributions.
If you have not contributed to the repository, but the tool has been helpful to you, we at CoST would love to hear the experience. Tell us about your experience in an Issue or via email to opencode@infrastructuretransparency.org

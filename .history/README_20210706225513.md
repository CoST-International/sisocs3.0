## 🧐 Description <a name = "descriptiont"></a>

The Information and Monitoring System for Supervision of Works and Contracts (SISOCS) was established as a subsystem of the Ministry of Infrastructure and Public Services' State Hiring and Procurement System, Honduomrpas (INSEP).

Through SISOCS, you can track the physical and financial status of projects. You also get a summary with basic information on project planning, procurement processes, contract management, as well as images and the projects' geographic position. Additionally, you can download related public data in a variety of formats, including xlsx, csv, and JSON.




## 🚀 Installing <a name = "deployment"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

The SISOCS is a loosely coupled platform consisting of 3 sub-systems that could essentialy operate as stand alone platforms only communicating to each other via the API

```
$ git clone https://example.com
$ cd ../path/to/the/file
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

## ✍️ Scope <a name = "scope"></a>

This Code of Conduct applies both within IDP and CoST repositories spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing CoST or its community. Examples of representing CoST or community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## ✍️ Enforcement <a name = "enforcement"></a>

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour may be reported by contacting this repository's maintainer or at opencode@infrastructuretransparency.org

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The CoST team is obligated to maintain confidentiality regarding the reporter of an incident.

The IDP maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by CoST.


## 🚀 Getting Involved <a name = "contributing"></a>

Infrastructure Disclosure Platforms (IDP) is CoST- the Infrastructure Transparency Initiative- effort to support CoST Members and other partners to contribute, explore and reuse open-source digital tools, which can be used in the design and implementation of the CoST disclosure journey aiming to improve transparency and accountability in the infrastructure sector around the world.

CoST believes that open-source codes developed by our members or partners should be publicly available to help us to contribute to delivering quality infrastructure, strengthening economies, and improving lives.

Therefore, CoST encourages those who contribute to the improvement of these digital tools, to share them with the IPD manager. If when reusing this digital tool, you consider that:

- Have added some new functionality with which you add value for more people to reuse,
- Have made the tool more versatile to support new updates,
- Have fixed some existing bugs,
- Or have simply improved the user interface or documentation of it.


CoST encourages you to return the progress made to the repository. Follow these steps to contribute to the digital tool:

- Fork the repository.
- Develop the new functionality or make the changes you create that add value to the tool.
- Make a "pull request" documenting in detail the proposed changes in the repository.
- In such case, your name will be registered in the list of attributions.
If you have not contributed to the repository, but the tool has been helpful to you, we at CoST would love to hear the experience. Tell us about your experience in an Issue or via email to opencode@infrastructuretransparency.org

### Using the issue tracker

You can also use the issue tracker to suggest feature requests, report bugs, and ask questions.
This is also a great way to connect with the developers of the project as well
as others who are interested in this solution.
